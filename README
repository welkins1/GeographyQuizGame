This is my second Java project that I've decided to upload on GitHub. 
It's a program that allows you to play a simple Geography quiz with varying difficulties.

This project took way longer than I thought, mainly because I wanted features in the program that I 
needed to learn how to implement.

This program relies heavily on array lists, which I have yet to learn within Java, and I'm sure the 
way I implemented them in the program was not the most efficient or beautiful way. 
At the time, though, this was the easiest way I knew of to create Arrays containing the questions and 
answers to the quiz.

This is the first program I've made with another Java class that correlates with the 
main program to make it run. I had to explore this, and I still need to figure out what some of 
the lines of code do outside of the comments I added. The "this." keyword was confusing to learn about,
and I'm still not exactly sure of its use other than to point the program in the right direction. 
I'm sure I'll learn more about it later on in my Java studies.

From what I can remember, there isn't a particular reason why I decided to make another source package 
outside the main program, I think I just wanted it all to be cleaner, or I needed to learn how 
to do it within the main coding space.

It was fun to figure out the Loading questions..... and Calculating score.... for loop.
NetBeams did the work for me when it came to the for loops; I only had to figure out the 
thread.sleep function and how to correctly display the dots. The java.util.Collections import was 
also interesting to learn about, and it was relatively easy to input.

Overall, I learned a lot in this program, and I'll continue to study what I learned.

P.S.

You can run GeographyQuizGame.java by running java GeographyQuizGame.java within the 
geographyquizgame directory.
