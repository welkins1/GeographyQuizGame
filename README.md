# GeoGraphyQuizGame üåé

This is my second Java program that I've decided to upload on GitHub. 
It's a program that allows you to play a simple Geography quiz with varying difficulties.

This project took way longer than I thought, mainly because I wanted features in the program that I 
needed to learn how to implement.

This program relies heavily on ```ArrayList```, which I have found to be more useful than regular arrays.
I needed to familiarize myself with the ```ArrayList``` function at the time, so I did some research. 
Nonetheless, they were easy to implement. 

It was fun to figure out the ```Loading questions.....``` and ```Calculating score....``` for loop.
NetBeams worked for me regarding the for loops; I only had to figure out the 
thread.sleep function and how to correctly display the dots. The ```java.util.Collections``` import was 
also interesting to learn about, and it was relatively easy to input.

Overall, I learned a lot in this program, and I'll continue to study what I learned.

# ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

You can run this program by downloading the .java file and running ```java GeoGraphyQuizGame.java``` in the directory you installed it in.
